# Display up to 16 MJPEG streams

This package can be used to display MJPEG streams generated by a lot of IP-connected
cameras like those from [Axis](https://www.axis.com/products/network-cameras).

You can add multiple camera urls to show multiple cameras at once. Right now the
limit is 16 cameras.

If you use four or more cameras, it's recommended to limit the capture size as
well as the framerate to reasonable values so all camera images can be realistically
updated fast enough by the Pi. For Axis cameras you can use Urls like the
following to control framerate and resolution:

```
/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi?resolution=cif&fps=5
```

You can specify an HTTP username/password per camera if your camera is password
protected. Both BasicAuth and DigestAuth authentication schemes are supported.

Each camera can have a name that is visible in the bottom left corner of each
image.
